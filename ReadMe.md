# Sesharp

Tool to generate markdown files from C# XML documentation.

## Name

A combination of [Seshat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seshat), the Egyptian goddess of writing, wisdom and knowledge and [C Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-sharp).
Yeah, it's not great, but all the various permutations of 'documentation generator' are gone and naming things is hard.
