# Sesharp

[![Build Status](https://github.com/MrKWatkins/Sesharp/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MrKWatkins/Sesharp/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Tool to generate markdown files from C# XML documentation. Also supports generating content tables for [Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/).

## Background

Still in development so probably best not use it yet. Wait until the NuGet global tool and documentation is ready. Plus it's designed for how I want to see documentation,
you might not like the layout, and I have no intention to make it flexible...

## Name

A combination of [Seshat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seshat), the Egyptian goddess of writing, wisdom and knowledge and [C Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-sharp).
Yeah, it's not great, but all the various permutations of 'documentation generator' are gone and naming things is hard.
